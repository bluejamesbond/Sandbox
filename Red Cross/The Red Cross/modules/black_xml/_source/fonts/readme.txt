Tip
--------------------------------------

Both of these fonts are pixel fonts and should be kept at a point size of 8. Otherwise they will look blurry.
If you intend to increase font size in the xml or switch to a non pixel font I suggest changing the dynamic text fields setting from bitmap to anti alias for readability.
