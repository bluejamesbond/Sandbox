<title>Nature Moment</title>
<thumb_image>images/nature/thumb_image/01.jpg</thumb_image>
<description>Nature refers to the phenomena of the physical universe, and life. Earth is the only planet known to support life, and the study of natural phenomena of living organisms: their origins, diversity, evolution, and interaction is therefore limited to Earth, while extraterrestrial life remains hypothetical. As such, the natural phenomena of Earth itself including its formation and history, weather, and geology are the subject of many fields of research.</description>
