<p><b>Package contents</b></p>
<p>The package you downloaded contains the following files:<br />
- documentation.html<br />
- file_upload2.fla<br />
- select_file2.php (where the user gets to select files) <br />
- success.php (shown when the files are uploaded) <br />
- upload.php (background file used to upload)
</p>
<p><b>Modification instructions</b></p>
<p><i>Getting things ready</i><br />
  To start uploading all you have to do is upload all files in the zip to a server (except for this documentation file). Be sure your server has php.</p>
<p><i>Changing the upload folder<br />
</i>You'll need to change two things to choose another upload folder.</p>
<p>1) In the select_file2.php file, on line 3 change $theUploadFolder to the folder you like, for example: $theUploadFolder = &quot;yourfolder&quot;;</p>
<p>2) in the upload.php file, on line 3, do the same. These two folder names should be the same!</p>
<p><i>Variables in the fla file<br />
</i>The following variables are changeable in the fla file.</p>
<table width="694" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
