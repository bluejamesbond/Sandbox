			<title>Princess Diana unlawfully killed </title>
			<description><html>Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were unlawfully killed due to the "gross negligence" of driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi, an inquest has found. The inquest jury also specified that Mr Paul's drink-driving and a lack of seatbelts contributed to their deaths.Princes William and Harry said they "agreed" with the verdicts and thanked the jury for the "thorough way" in which they considered the evidence.But Mr Al Fayed's father Mohamed has refused to accept the verdict.The jury of six women and five men returned joint verdicts of unlawful killing through grossly negligent driving - or gross negligence manslaughter, by majorities of nine to two.The inquest into the 1997 Paris crash that killed the couple and Mr Paul lasted six months.The total cost to British taxpayers of investigating Princess Diana's death is expected to top £10 million.'Profound gratitude'A poll of 1,000 people conducted on behalf of the BBC's Newsnight programme found 78% of people thought the estimated £10 million bill had not been well spent.It also found the majority (62%) of those asked thought the princess's death was a tragic accident.					   Princess Diana and Dodi Al Fayed were killed when Mr Paul crashed a hired Mercedes into a pillar in the Pont de l'Alma in Paris in the early hours of 31 August, 1997. </html></description>

			<title>Rare lynx appears in Italian Alps</title>
			<description><html>A lynx has appeared in the Italian Alps for the first time in 100 years.The authorities in Italy's South Tyrol region say the lynx, which crossed the mountains from Switzerland, does not pose a threat to livestock in the area.The lynx was fitted with a signalling collar after being captured in Switzerland in February.Lynx were wiped out by hunters and farmers in the region in the early 20th Century. They were reintroduced in Switzerland in the 1970s.On Friday the South Tyrol authorities said the lynx spotted in the area had wandered through the Pejo Valley and had stopped in the Deutschnonsberg area of South Tyrol.The WWF conservation organisation says there are about 100 lynx in Switzerland, in two main areas: the northwestern Alps, which includes Interlaken, and the Jura Mountains near Lake Geneva.Lynx are solitary hunters, inhabiting high-altitude forests and preying on small mammals such as hares, foxes and small deer as well as fish. </html></description>

			<title>Persistence pays off for Portishead</title>
			<description><html>In 1994, a three-piece band from Bristol released their debut album - and became the flagbearers of a new brand of late-night, atmospheric electronica, heavy on spy-film strings and slow, languid beats. That album, Dummy, mixed samples from old jazz records alongside DJ scratches, snatches of Lalo Schifrin instrumentals, Isaac Hayes guitar riffs, skittering beats and the chilling voice of frontwoman Beth Gibbons. In a music scene suddenly obsessed with plundering the rinky-dink piano riffs of The Kinks and the simpler end of The Beatles' canon, Portishead's debut was an intriguing alternative. Within months, they became one of Britain's biggest cult bands, a three-headed collective built around Gibbons, guitarist Adrian Utley and self-confessed hip-hop obsessive Geoff Barrow.<br /> Decade-long silence<br /> Dummy became an unexpected hit and won 1995's Mercury Prize for the best British or Irish album of the year. By 1997, when their self-titled second album came out, things were even more widescreen and menacing. The strong follow-up was itself followed by a live release - complete with orchestra - recorded in New York. </html></description>
