Going to Jail in the Game of MONOPOLY:

You land in Jail when... (1) your MONOPOLY token lands on the space marked "Go to Jail"; (2) you draw a card marked "Go to Jail"; or (3) you throw doubles three times in succession.

When you are sent to Jail you cannot collect your $200 salary in that move since, regardless of where your token is on the game board, you must move directly into Jail. Your turn ends when you are sent to Jail.

If you are not "sent" to Jail but in the ordinary course of play land on that space of the MONOPOLY game board, you are "Just Visiting," you incur no penalty, and you move ahead in the usual manner on your next turn.

You get out of Jail by... (1) throwing doubles on any of your next three turns; if you succeed in doing this you immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your doubles throw; even though you had thrown doubles, you do not take another turn; (2) using the "Get Out of Jail Free" card if you have it; (3) purchasing the "Get Out of Jail Free" card from another player and playing it; (4) paying a fine of $50 before you roll the dice on either of your next two turns.

If you do not throw doubles by your third turn, you must pay the $50 fine. You then get out of Jail and immediately move forward the number of spaces shown by your throw.

Even though you are in Jail, you may buy and sell MONOPOLY properties, buy and sell houses and hotels and collect rents.
