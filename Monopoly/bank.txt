The MONOPOLY Bank:

Besides the Bank's money, the MONOPOLY Bank holds the Title Deed cards and houses and hotels prior to purchase and use by the players. The Bank pays salaries and bonuses. It sells and auctions properties and hands out their proper Title Deed cards; it sells houses and hotels to the players and loans money when required on mortgages.
	
The Bank collects all taxes, fines, loans and interest, and the price of all MONOPOLY properties which it sells and auctions.
	
The Bank never "goes broke". If the Bank runs out of MONOPOLY money it may issue as much more as may be needed by merely writing on any ordinary paper.
