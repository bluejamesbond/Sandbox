Preparation for the game of MONOPOLY:

Place the MONOPOLY game board on a table and put the Chance and Community Chest cards face-down on their allotted spaces on the game board. Each player chooses one MONOPOLY token to represent him/her on his travels around the game board.

Each player is given $1500 divided as follows: 2 each of $500's, $100's and $50's; 6-$20's; 5 each of $10's, $5's and $1's.

All remaining MONOPOLY money and other MONOPOLY equipment go to the Bank.
