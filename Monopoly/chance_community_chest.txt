Chance & Community Chest Cards in MONOPOLY:

When a player lands on either of these spaces on the MONOPOLY game board, he takes the top card from the deck indicated, follows the instructions and returns the card face-down to the bottom of the deck.

The "Get Out of Jail Free" card is held until used and then returned to the bottom of the deck. If the player who draws it does not wish to use it he may sell it, at any time, to another player at a price agreeable to both.
