Rules for a Short Game of MONOPOLY (60 to 90 minutes):

There are three changed rules for this Short Game.

1. During PREPARATION for game play, the Banker shuffles the pack of Title Deed cards, has the player to the left cut them, then deals out two, one at a time, to each player. The players must immediately pay the Bank the printed price of each. Game play then begins as in the regular game of MONOPOLY.

2. In this short game, it is necessary to have only three houses (instead of four) on each lot of a complete color-group before the player may buy a hotel.

Rent for a hotel remains the same as in the regular game of MONOPOLY.

The turn-in value of a hotel is still one-half the purchase price, which in this game is one house fewer than in the regular game of MONOPOLY.

3. END OF GAME. The first player to go bankrupt retires from game play, as in the regular game of MONOPOLY; however, when the second bankruptcy occurs, the game ends. Game play immediately ceases, with the bankrupt player's turning over to his/her creditor all that he/she has of value, including buildings and any other properties. This happens whether the creditor is a rival player or the Bank.

Each remaining player then values his/her property: (1) cash on hand; (2) lots, utilities and railroads owned, at the price printed on the board; (3) any mortgaged property owned, at one-half the price printed on the game board; (4) houses, valued at purchase price; (5) hotels, valued at purchase price including the value of the three houses turned in.

The richest player wins the game!

Another Good Short Game of MONOPOLY:

TIME LIMIT GAME... Before starting, agree upon a definite hour of termination, when the richest player will be declared the winner. Before starting the game, the Banker shuffles and cuts the Title Deed cards and deals two to each player. Players immediately pay the Bank the price of the properties dealt to them.
