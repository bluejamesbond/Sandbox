Rules of Selling Property in MONOPOLY:

Unimproved MONOPOLY properties, railroads and utilities (but not buildings) may be sold to any player as a private transaction for any amount the owner can get; however, no MONOPOLY property can be sold to another player if buildings are standing on any properties of that color-group. Any buildings so located must be sold back to the Bank before the owner can sell any property of that color-group.

Houses and hotels may be sold back to the Bank at any time for one-half the price paid for them.

All houses on one color-group may be sold at once, or they may be sold one house at a time (one hotel equals five houses), evenly, in reverse of the manner in which they were erected.
